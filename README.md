# CV-Basics

OpenCV supports a lot of algorithms related to Computer Vision and Machine Learning. OpenCV-Python is the Python API of OpenCV. It combines the best qualities of OpenCV C++ API and Python language.All the OpenCV array structures are converted to-and-from Numpy arrays. So whatever operations we can do in Numpy, we can combine it with OpenCV.

This include thresholding, transposing, smoothing of an image.
